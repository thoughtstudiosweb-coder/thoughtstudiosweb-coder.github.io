There's a lot of advice about "getting ready", usually before making a change.

Some say, wait.

You'll know when you're ready.

The universe will nudge you.

Others say, no.

You'll never be ready.

Just do it. Take the first step. Move through the fear.

For me, neither is fully right.

Leaving my job and green card to go back to school?

Not the universe pushing me.

Not a forced first step.

It was a plunge, but only because I'd reached the point where I was bored.

Bored with what I was doing, even though I was good at it.

The gym? Not a "New Year, New Me" stunt.

I joined because I love the high from sprints. That's it.

I didn't start lifting weights immediately, even though people around me said,

When I did, it was to get faster at sprints.

I didn't care for any other reason.

"It's time."

Life choices are messy. Dating, not dating, getting married, getting divorced, having kids, leaving a job, following a passion.

Advice is useful. It broadens your perspective.

You seek it, sit with it, absorb it.

Some things stick immediately.

Some click later.

Or maybe nothing resonates.

None of it matters until you've figured out why you, uniquely, would actually care.

But when something as simple as:

"this gives me a high"

"this is different"

"this is amusing"

hits.

That's your signal.

The moment every other argument pales in comparison, your why is real and clear.

Ready or Not

That might be the moment you finally do the thing you've been putting off, without even needing to know if you're "ready."
