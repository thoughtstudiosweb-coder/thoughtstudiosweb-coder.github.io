Lately I've been thinking about how often we give ordinary stuff epic meaning.

A text response that wasn't instant.

A one-word reply to a long message on WhatsApp.

A small comment.

A simple request.

Not because it is that deep.

But because sitting in a calm, neutral state feels unfamiliar.

We're oddly uncomfortable being comfortable.

So we assign importance. We analyze. We dig.

And if we dig long enough, we can always come up with a story that makes us uncomfortable.

What if we ask:

Does this actually matter?

Do I care?

If I did or didn't care, what would change?

If I knew exactly why the response was terse or delayed, would it change what I do next, right now?

Will knowing the other person's intent change what I want or where my boundary is?

Often, the answer is no.

Then, move on.

The same thing shows up at work.

Not because the work demands it.

But because the simplest outcome feels incomplete.

So we keep shaping it, adding weight. Spending a year debating inconsequential decisions.

Until someone finally says what others sense.

It's not that complicated. Or that important. Either decision is fine.

That attitude isn't dismissive.

It's clarifying.

It's permission to let easy be easy.
